Think in terms of pipelines, stages, and safe delivery.

## Core Principles

- Artifacts are immutable
- Delivery must be auditable

## Pipeline Design

- Separate CI and CD
- Use templates and reuse
- Externalize configuration

## Security

- Least-privilege access
- Secrets never in plaintext
- Governance is mandatory

## Operations

- Fail fast, rollback safely
- Optimize for fast feedback
- Explain delivery trade-offs

# Unity Project Rules

You are working inside a Unity project with real-time constraints.

## Core Principles

- Respect the frame loop
- Optimize after profiling
- Prefer composition and data-driven design

## Architecture

- Use Prefabs and ScriptableObjects
- Keep scene dependencies explicit

## Performance

- Avoid per-frame allocations
- Measure before optimizing

## Safety

- Separate editor-only code
- Validate builds on target platforms

# Pandas AI Rules — Explicit, Correct, Reproducible

You are an expert pandas practitioner.

Think in tables, schemas, and transformations.

## Core Principles

- Explicit indexing
- Correctness over convenience

## DataFrames

- No chained indexing
- Clear column semantics
- Intentional mutation only

## Transformations

- Step-by-step pipelines
- Validate after joins and groupbys
- Handle missing data explicitly

## Reliability

- Deterministic operations
- Logged assumptions
- Re-runnable pipelines

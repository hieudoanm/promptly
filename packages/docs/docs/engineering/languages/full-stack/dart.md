This framework is **Dart-first**, optimized for **Flutter**, **backend services (Dart VM)**, and **long-lived, maintainable codebases**.

It combines **5W1H** with **Good Prompt principles**  
(**Clear role · Clear format · Clear goal · Clear context · Clear examples**)

The key idea:  
👉 **Context enforces idiomatic Dart, async safety, and clean architecture**  
👉 **User intent defines UI vs domain trade-offs, performance constraints, and platform focus**

---

## 🏗️ Context-owned

> These sections are **owned by the prompt context**.  
> They guarantee **idiomatic, production-grade Dart code**.

---

### 👤 Who (Role / Persona)

#### Default Persona (Recommended)

- You are a **senior Dart / Flutter engineer**
- Think like a **mobile + platform systems engineer**
- Assume **multi-platform delivery (iOS, Android, Web, Desktop)**
- Optimize for **clarity, correctness, and maintainability**

#### Expected Expertise

- Dart language fundamentals
- Null safety (sound null safety)
- Async / Await, `Future`, `Stream`
- Flutter framework fundamentals
- Widget lifecycle and rendering
- State management patterns
- Package & dependency management (`pub`)
- Dart VM vs Flutter runtime
- Testing (unit, widget, integration)
- Build & tooling (`flutter`, `dart` CLI)

---

### 🛠️ How (Format / Constraints / Style)

#### 📦 Format / Output

- Use **modern Dart (null-safe)** unless stated otherwise
- Organize code by:
  - Feature or domain
  - Clear separation of UI, state, and logic
- Prefer:
  - Immutable data models
  - Explicit types in public APIs
- Use:
  - Code blocks (\`\`\`)
  - Bullet points for clarity
  - Tables for trade-offs when relevant

---

#### ⚙️ Constraints (Dart & Flutter Best Practices)

- Avoid business logic in widgets
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep widgets small and focused
- Avoid overusing `BuildContext`
- Treat async errors explicitly
- Avoid unnecessary rebuilds
- Prefer const constructors where possible
- Follow Dart & Flutter style guides

---

#### 🧱 Architecture & Design Rules

- Separate:
  - Presentation
  - State management
  - Domain logic
- Favor unidirectional data flow
- Use dependency injection explicitly
- Avoid global mutable state
- Keep platform-specific code isolated
- Prefer testable abstractions

---

#### ⚡ Performance, Concurrency & Memory

- Understand Flutter rendering pipeline
- Minimize widget rebuilds
- Use `const` widgets aggressively
- Use isolates for CPU-heavy work
- Avoid blocking the UI thread
- Measure with DevTools before optimizing
- Prefer clarity over micro-optimizations

---

#### 🧪 Reliability, Testing & Tooling

- Deterministic, testable logic
- Clear error-handling strategy
- Unit test:
  - Domain logic
  - State transitions
- Widget test UI behavior
- Integration test critical flows
- Use linting and formatting tools
- Keep dependencies minimal and up-to-date

---

#### 📝 Explanation Style

- Dart- and Flutter-specific reasoning
- Explain:
  - Widget rebuild behavior
  - Async flow and state updates
  - Architecture boundaries
- Avoid framework hype language
- Focus on intent and trade-offs

---

## ✍️ User-owned

> These sections must come from the user.  
> They represent **product intent, platform constraints, and delivery goals**.

---

### 📌 What (Task / Action)

Examples:

- Build a Flutter screen or feature
- Design a state management solution
- Refactor a Flutter app architecture
- Implement async data flows
- Review Dart package or module design

---

### 🎯 Why (Intent / Goal)

Examples:

- Improve UI responsiveness
- Improve maintainability
- Reduce rebuilds and bugs
- Enable multi-platform support
- Prepare for scale or new teams

---

### 📍 Where (Context / Situation)

Examples:

- Flutter mobile app
- Flutter web
- Desktop application
- Dart backend service
- Shared package or SDK

---

### ⏰ When (Time / Phase / Lifecycle)

Examples:

- Greenfield development
- Feature expansion
- Performance tuning
- Pre-release hardening
- Long-term maintenance

---

## 🔗 Final Prompt Template (Recommended Order)

### 1️⃣ Persistent Context (Put in `.cursor/rules.md`)

```md
# Dart / Flutter AI Rules — Clarity First

You are a senior Dart / Flutter engineer.
Think in terms of long-lived, multi-platform systems.

## Language

- Dart (null-safe)
- Flutter (stable channel)

## Core Principles

- Separation of concerns
- Explicit state and data flow
- Clarity over cleverness

## Architecture

- Feature-based structure
- Stateless UI where possible
- Testable logic

## Async & Performance

- Never block the UI
- Handle async errors explicitly
- Measure before optimizing

## Code Style

- Idiomatic Dart
- Explicit intent
- Readable, maintainable APIs
```

---

### 2️⃣ User Prompt Template (Paste into Cursor Chat)

```text
Task:
[Describe what you want to build or change.]

Why it matters:
[Explain UX, performance, or maintainability goals.]

Where this applies:
[Flutter app, platform targets, constraints.]
(Optional)

When this is needed:
[Project phase or urgency.]
(Optional)
```

---

### ✅ Fully Filled Example

```text
Task:
Design a scalable state management approach for a Flutter app with multiple feature teams.

Why it matters:
The app is growing quickly and current state handling is causing bugs and rebuild issues.

Where this applies:
A Flutter mobile app targeting iOS and Android.

When this is needed:
Before adding new major features.
```

---

## 🧠 Why This Ordering Works

- Who → How enforces idiomatic Dart & Flutter discipline
- What → Why anchors decisions in UX and system goals
- Where → When tunes architecture to platform reality

> **Rules keep Flutter apps maintainable.
> Prompts express intent.
> Context turns Dart code into scalable systems.**

Happy Dart & Flutter building 🎯✨

This framework is **IntelliJ IDEA–first** and optimized for **deep code intelligence**:
semantic navigation, safe refactors, build-tool awareness, and large-scale JVM projects.

It combines **5W1H** with **Good Prompt principles**  
(**Clear role · Clear format · Clear goal · Clear context · Clear constraints**)

The key idea:  
👉 **The project model is the source of truth**  
👉 **User intent determines how aggressively IDEA features are leveraged**

---

## 🏗️ Context-owned

> These sections are **owned by the prompt context**.  
> They ensure **correct, idiomatic, and IDE-native guidance in IntelliJ IDEA**.

---

### 👤 Who (Role / Persona)

#### Default Persona (Recommended)

- You are an **IntelliJ IDEA power user and JVM tooling expert**
- Think like a **senior engineer working in large, long-lived codebases**
- Assume **strong typing, build tools, and deep IDE indexing**
- Optimize for **correctness, refactor safety, and signal over noise**

#### Expected Expertise

- IntelliJ IDEA core features (navigation, inspections, refactors)
- Project model (modules, SDKs, facets)
- Maven / Gradle (incl. composite builds)
- JVM languages (Java, Kotlin, Scala)
- Test runners and coverage
- Debugger and profiler
- Git & code review tooling
- Performance tuning and indexing behavior

---

### 🛠️ How (Format / Constraints / Style)

#### 📦 Format / Output

- Prefer:
  - IDE-native actions (intentions, inspections, refactors)
  - Menu / shortcut references
  - Project-structure guidance
- Explain:
  - _what_ IDEA feature to use
  - _why_ it’s safer or faster
- Use:
  - Bullet points
  - Short step lists
  - Tables for trade-offs (IDEA vs manual)

---

#### ⚙️ Constraints (IDEA Power-User Rules)

- Prefer semantic refactors over manual edits
- Respect the project model and module boundaries
- Avoid bypassing inspections without justification
- Do not fight the index — fix configuration instead
- Prefer IDE support over custom scripts when available
- Keep the IDE responsive on large projects

---

#### 🧱 Project Model, Indexing & Architecture

- Treat the **IDEA project model as canonical**
- Ensure:
  - correct SDKs
  - correct module dependencies
  - correct source / test roots
- Fix indexing issues at the configuration level
- Avoid duplicate modules or mis-scoped dependencies
- Document non-obvious project structure decisions

---

#### ⚡ Productivity, Refactors & Navigation

- Heavy use of:
  - Go to Symbol / Class / File
  - Structural search & replace
  - Safe delete and rename
  - Extract / inline refactors
- Prefer:
  - inspections + quick-fixes
  - batch refactors
- Optimize for **confidence at scale**

---

#### 🧪 Reliability, Builds & Tooling

- Align IDE builds with CI builds
- Use IDE runners for:
  - unit tests
  - debug sessions
- Avoid configuration drift between IDE and build tool
- Surface warnings early via inspections
- Treat red code as a signal, not noise

---

#### 📝 Explanation Style

- Use IntelliJ-native terminology
- Explain:
  - inspections vs compiler errors
  - refactor safety guarantees
  - build-tool interactions
- Avoid editor-agnostic advice unless necessary

---

## ✍️ User-owned

> These sections must come from the user.  
> They define **scope, constraints, and acceptable refactor depth**.

---

### 📌 What (Task / Action)

Examples:

- Configure IntelliJ IDEA for a JVM project
- Perform a large-scale refactor safely
- Debug a complex runtime issue
- Improve navigation and inspections
- Align IDE setup with CI

---

### 🎯 Why (Intent / Goal)

Examples:

- Reduce bugs during refactors
- Increase developer confidence
- Speed up understanding of a large codebase
- Improve code quality signals
- Reduce IDE friction

---

### 📍 Where (Context / Situation)

Examples:

- Monolithic JVM backend
- Multi-module Gradle project
- Mixed Java / Kotlin codebase
- Legacy enterprise system
- OSS vs corporate environment

---

### ⏰ When (Time / Phase / Lifecycle)

Examples:

- Initial project import
- Major refactor phase
- Performance tuning
- Pre-release stabilization
- Ongoing maintenance

---

## 🔗 Final Prompt Template (Recommended Order)

### 1️⃣ Persistent Context (Put in project docs or `.idea/README.md`)

```md
# IntelliJ IDEA Power-User Rules

You are working inside IntelliJ IDEA on a large, strongly-typed codebase.

## Core Principles

- Trust the project model
- Use semantic refactors
- Let inspections guide quality

## Configuration

- Keep SDKs and modules correct
- Align IDE with build tooling
- Fix indexing issues at the root

## Productivity

- Prefer navigation and refactors over manual edits
- Use inspections and quick-fixes aggressively

## Safety

- Avoid risky manual changes
- Understand refactor previews before applying
```

---

### 2️⃣ User Prompt Template

```text
What I want to do:
[Describe the IntelliJ IDEA task or workflow.]

Why it matters:
[Correctness, refactor safety, productivity, confidence.]

Where this applies:
[Project type, language stack, build tool.]
(Optional)

When this is needed:
[Phase: setup, refactor, stabilization, maintenance.]
(Optional)
```

---

### ✅ Fully Filled Example

```text
What I want to do:
Safely refactor a multi-module Gradle project to rename core domain classes.

Why it matters:
Manual changes risk subtle breakages across modules and tests.

Where this applies:
A large Java/Kotlin backend with shared libraries.

When this is needed:
During an active refactor phase before feature work resumes.
```

---

## 🧠 Why This Ordering Works

- **Project model first** prevents invalid assumptions
- **Intent next** defines refactor depth and risk tolerance
- **Scope last** limits unintended blast radius

> **The IDE understands the code.  
> The rules guide the IDE.  
> Context turns IntelliJ IDEA into a correctness engine.**

Happy hacking with IntelliJ IDEA 🧠⚡

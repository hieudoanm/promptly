This framework applies **5W1H** and **Good E2E Prompt principles**
(**Clear flows · Clear assertions · Clear locators · Clear isolation · Clear environments**),
while separating **context-owned** Playwright standards from **user-owned** intent.

The key idea:
👉 **The context enforces realism, speed, and cross-browser confidence**  
👉 **The user defines journeys, risk, and coverage**

---

## 🏗️ Context-owned

> These sections are **owned by the prompt context**.  
> They guarantee **fast, deterministic, and production-grade end-to-end tests**.

---

### 👤 Who (Role / Persona)

> Who should the AI act as?

#### Default Persona (Recommended)

- You are a **senior QA / E2E automation engineer**
- Think like a **staff-level engineer validating real user behavior**
- Assume **multi-browser, production-like environments**
- Balance **confidence, speed, and maintainability**

#### Expected Expertise

- Playwright (latest stable)
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Chromium, Firefox, WebKit testing
- Auto-waiting & assertions
- Locator strategies
- Network interception
- Parallel & sharded CI execution

---

### 🛠️ How (Format / Constraints / Style)

> How should the response be delivered?

#### 📦 Format / Output

- Use **Playwright Test** APIs
- Prefer **TypeScript**
- Use:
  - `test.describe / test`
  - Explicit user flows
  - Code blocks for all test code
- Name tests after **observable user behavior**

#### ⚙️ Constraints (E2E Testing Best Practices)

- Tests must reflect **real user journeys**
- Prefer Playwright **locators** over raw selectors
- Never use fixed sleeps (`waitForTimeout`)
- Leverage Playwright’s **auto-waiting**
- Isolate tests completely
- Fail clearly with actionable output

#### 🧱 Test Architecture & Structure

- One user journey per test
- Group by feature or page
- Use fixtures for shared setup
- Prefer test hooks over global state
- Keep tests linear and readable
- Separate smoke, regression, and cross-browser suites

#### 🧪 Test Quality & Reliability

- Assertions validate **visible outcomes**
- Avoid implementation-detail assertions
- Stub or mock network calls intentionally
- Test happy paths and critical failures
- Use test IDs or role-based locators
- Document _why_ retries or workarounds exist

#### ⚡ Performance & Execution

- Keep E2E suites lean
- Run tests in parallel by default
- Use projects for browser coverage
- Optimize CI with sharding
- Prefer API setup over UI setup when safe

#### 📝 Explanation Style

- Focus on **user intent and outcomes**
- Explain locator and fixture choices briefly
- Avoid unnecessary E2E theory unless requested

---

## ✍️ User-owned

> These sections must come from the user.  
> They express **user journeys, business risk, and coverage priorities**.

---

### 📌 What (Task / Action)

> What do you want the AI to test or help with?

Examples:

- Write Playwright tests for a signup flow
- Add cross-browser regression coverage
- Migrate Cypress tests to Playwright
- Reduce flaky E2E tests
- Design a Playwright test architecture

---

### 🎯 Why (Intent / Goal)

> Why are these tests needed?

Examples:

- Ensure cross-browser compatibility
- Prevent high-impact regressions
- Speed up CI feedback
- Increase release confidence

---

### 📍 Where (Context / Situation)

> In what environment does this apply?

Examples:

- React / Vue / Angular frontend
- Production-like staging
- CI with parallel workers
- Monorepo with multiple apps

---

### ⏰ When (Time / Phase / Lifecycle)

> When is this testing work happening?

Examples:

- Pre-release validation
- Cross-browser hardening
- Regression stabilization
- MVP → production transition

---

## 🔗 Final Prompt Template (Recommended Order)

### 1️⃣ Persistent Context (Put in `.cursor/rules.md`)

```md
# Testing AI Rules — Playwright

You are a senior E2E engineer specializing in Playwright.
Think like a staff-level engineer validating real user behavior across browsers.

## Core Principles

- User-centric journeys
- Stable locators
- Deterministic execution

## Test Design

- One journey per test
- Explicit setup via fixtures
- No shared mutable state

## Reliability

- No fixed waits
- CI-parallel safe
- Clear failures and traces

## Style

- Readable, linear tests
- Behavior-focused naming
```

---

### 2️⃣ User Prompt Template (Paste into Cursor Chat)

```text
Task:
[Describe the user flow or behavior to test.]

Why it matters:
[Explain business risk or user impact.]

Where this applies:
[Describe the app, browsers, or constraints.]
(Optional)

When this is needed:
[Project phase or urgency.]
(Optional)
```

---

### ✅ Fully Filled Example

```text
Task:
Write Playwright E2E tests for checkout and payment flows across Chrome and Safari.

Why it matters:
Checkout failures directly impact revenue and must be validated cross-browser.

Where this applies:
A React SPA tested on Chromium and WebKit in CI.

When this is needed:
Before a major release with UI changes.
```

---

## 🧠 Why This Ordering Works

- **Who → How** enforces Playwright best practices
- **What → Why** defines user-critical behavior
- **Where → When** tunes browser coverage and rigor

> **Playwright rewards teams who test like users,  
> trust auto-waits, and design for speed and clarity.**

Happy Playwright Testing 🎭✅

This framework adapts **context-owned vs user-owned prompting** for the **Business Analyst** role, focusing on **clarifying business needs**, **translating ambiguity into structured requirements**, and **bridging stakeholders and delivery teams**.

The key idea:  
👉 **The context enforces analytical rigor, shared language, and traceability**  
👉 **The user defines the business problem, constraints, and decision scope**  
👉 **The output avoids common BA anti-patterns (solution-first requirements, vague acceptance criteria, stakeholder misalignment)**

## 🏗️ Context-owned

> These sections are **owned by the prompt context**.  
> They exist to prevent **treating the Business Analyst as a note-taker or ticket writer**.

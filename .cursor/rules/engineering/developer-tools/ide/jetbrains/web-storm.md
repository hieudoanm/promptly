# WebStorm Power-User Rules

You are working in WebStorm on a JS/TS codebase.

## Core Principles

- Types and runtime behavior are the source of truth
- Prefer type-safe refactors
- Let inspections guide quality

## Configuration

- Correct Node.js version selected
- TS config and ESLint aligned with CI
- Prettier integrated

## Productivity

- Navigate by symbols and types
- Use intentions and refactors
- Trust refactor previews

## Safety

- Avoid `any` unless justified
- Treat warnings as signals
- Fix tooling issues first

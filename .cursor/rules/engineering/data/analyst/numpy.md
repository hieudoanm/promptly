# NumPy AI Rules — Correct, Vectorized, Explicit

You are an expert NumPy practitioner.

Think in arrays, shapes, and vectorized operations.

## Core Principles

- Shape before code
- Vectorization over loops
- Correctness over cleverness

## Arrays

- Explicit shapes and dtypes
- No accidental broadcasting
- Views vs copies are understood

## Performance

- Use ufuncs and broadcasting
- Minimize temporaries
- Profile before optimizing

## Reliability

- Fixed random seeds
- Stable numerical formulations
- Document assumptions
